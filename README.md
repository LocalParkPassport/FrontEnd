##Web Unit 2 MVP Requirements[Suffyan Tariq]:

Student created functional components and used events in application to add dynamic functionality to app.

Student's code was organized at the component level, proper usage of state and props are demonstrated throughout the project, the UI is composed of small reusable components, proper usage of useState and useEffect hooks are clearly incorporated and correctly implemented.  Student used Array methods to dynamically render HTML elements.

Student implemented GET requests using either Axios or Fetch to display 3rd party data on a deployed page. Route management properly installed and used to show top level pages as well as nested views where necessary.

Student has set up component management for the forms in the app that makes sense for each form. Student made the decision to use a third-party library, like Formik, or not, and can defend their decision. Some form validation is in place.

##Web Unit 3 MVP Requirements[Dante Bui]:

React application is deployed and the static landing page is correctly incorporated with the app.

CRUD operations drive the application. Each participating student individually created pages that complete all CRUD operations. Token authentication is handled correctly.

Student has implemented a state management system that makes sense for the project. It is organized well and implemented correctly. State is not lost as user goes through the application.

###Stretch:

App is deployed, and continuous deployment is set up in a manner that is conducive to a team project environment. Project is organized well on GitHub. Extra considerations were made to help all team members understand how to contribute easily to the project, no matter their role.

Pages making HTTP requests do so in a logical manner that is cohesive with the app's state management system. Student showed great care and insight when handling token authentication. Student used a modular system for all requests (e.g. like a  useFetch custom hook).

Student showed the ability to manage state in a very coherent system at all levels of the app - global state management, component tree state management, and individual component management. The system is easy to understand and use. Student may have also architected it in such a way that it is reusable for a lot of the state management needs of the app.
